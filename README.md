# Latitude-and-Longitude-Finder
The program takes the street address, city, state, and country.  It outputs the complete address, latitude and longitude.
If the street name and city are unique, user does not need to enter the state or the country to get desired results
The program uses the GeoPy Python client to pin-point the exact location and extract the latitude and longitude.
The GUI used in this program is Tkinter which  is a GUI for Python.
